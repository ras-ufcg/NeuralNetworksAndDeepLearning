# Toward deep learning

While our neural network gives impressive performance, that performance is somewhat mysterious. The weights and biases in the network 
were discovered automatically. And that means we don't immediately have an explanation of how the network does what it does. Can we 
find some way to understand the principles by which our network is classifying handwritten digits? And, given such principles, can 
we do better?

To put these questions more starkly, suppose that a few decades hence neural networks lead to artificial intelligence (AI). Will we 
understand how such intelligent networks work? Perhaps the networks will be opaque to us, with weights and biases we don't understand, 
because they've been learned automatically. In the early days of AI research people hoped that the effort to build an AI would also 
help us understand the principles behind intelligence and, maybe, the functioning of the human brain. But perhaps the outcome will be 
that we end up understanding neither the brain nor how artificial intelligence works!

To address these questions, let's think back to the interpretation of artificial neurons that I gave at the start of the chapter, as 
a means of weighing evidence. Suppose we want to determine whether an image shows a human face or not:

We could attack this problem the same way we attacked handwriting recognition - by using the pixels in the image as input to a neural 
network, with the output from the network a single neuron indicating either "Yes, it's a face" or "No, it's not a face".

Let's suppose we do this, but that we're not using a learning algorithm. Instead, we're going to try to design a network by hand, 
choosing appropriate weights and biases. How might we go about it? Forgetting neural networks entirely for the moment, a heuristic 
we could use is to decompose the problem into sub-problems: does the image have an eye in the top left? Does it have an eye in the 
top right? Does it have a nose in the middle? Does it have a mouth in the bottom middle? Is there hair on top? And so on.

If the answers to several of these questions are "yes", or even just "probably yes", then we'd conclude that the image is likely to be 
a face. Conversely, if the answers to most of the questions are "no", then the image probably isn't a face.
    
Of course, this is just a rough heuristic, and it suffers from many deficiencies. Maybe the person is bald, so they have no hair. Maybe 
we can only see part of the face, or the face is at an angle, so some of the facial features are obscured. Still, the heuristic 
suggests that if we can solve the sub-problems using neural networks, then perhaps we can build a neural network for face-detection, 
by combining the networks for the sub-problems. Here's a possible architecture, with rectangles denoting the sub-networks. Note that 
this isn't intended as a realistic approach to solving the face-detection problem; rather, it's to help us build intuition about how 
networks function. Here's the architecture:

It's also plausible that the sub-networks can be decomposed. Suppose we're considering the question: "Is there an eye in the top left?" 
This can be decomposed into questions such as: "Is there an eyebrow?"; "Are there eyelashes?"; "Is there an iris?"; and so on. Of 
course, these questions should really include positional information, as well - "Is the eyebrow in the top left, and above the iris?", 
that kind of thing - but let's keep it simple. The network to answer the question "Is there an eye in the top left?" can now be 
decomposed:

</p>
    
Those questions too can be broken down, further and further through multiple layers. Ultimately, we'll be working with sub-networks 
that answer questions so simple they can easily be answered at the level of single pixels. Those questions might, for example, 
be about the presence or absence of very simple shapes at particular points in the image. Such questions can be answered by single 
neurons connected to the raw pixels in the image.
    
The end result is a network which breaks down a very complicated question - does this image show a face or not - into very simple questions 
answerable at the level of single pixels. It does this through a series of many layers, with early layers answering very simple and specific 
questions about the input image, and later layers building up a hierarchy of ever more complex and abstract concepts. Networks with this 
kind of many-layer structure - two or more hidden layers - are called **deep neural networks**.
    
Of course, I haven't said how to do this recursive decomposition into sub-networks. It certainly isn't practical to hand-design the weights 
and biases in the network. Instead, we'd like to use learning algorithms so that the network can automatically learn the weights and biases - 
and thus, the hierarchy of concepts - from training data. Researchers in the 1980s and 1990s tried using stochastic gradient descent and 
backpropagation to train deep networks. Unfortunately, except for a few special architectures, they didn't have much luck. The networks 
would learn, but very slowly, and in practice often too slowly to be useful.
    
Since 2006, a set of techniques has been developed that enable learning in deep neural nets. These deep learning techniques are based on 
stochastic gradient descent and backpropagation, but also introduce new ideas. These techniques have enabled much deeper (and larger) 
networks to be trained - people now routinely train networks with 5 to 10 hidden layers. And, it turns out that these perform far better 
on many problems than shallow neural networks, i.e., networks with just a single hidden layer. The reason, of course, is the ability of 
deep nets to build up a complex hierarchy of concepts. It's a bit like the way conventional programming languages use modular design and 
ideas about abstraction to enable the creation of complex computer programs. Comparing a deep network to a shallow network is a bit like 
comparing a programming language with the ability to make function calls to a stripped down language with no ability to make such calls. 
Abstraction takes a different form in neural networks than it does in conventional programming, but it's just as important.
